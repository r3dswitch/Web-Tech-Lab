<!ELEMENT question-paper (question*)>
<!ELEMENT question (text, optionA, optionB, optionC, optionD, answer)>
<!ELEMENT text (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT optionA (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT optionB (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT optionC (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT optionD (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT answer (#PCDATA)>

<!ATTLIST question no CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST answer value  (optionA|optionB|optionC|optionD) #REQUIRED>
 
Now, validate your XML file against this DTD. 

12.	Use HTML5 canvas and <SVG> tag to create following picture. Create one and use transformation to create others.
 
13.	Consider a web page that locally stores (using IndexDB) the details (such as name, manufacturer, price etc)  of different components(e.g. HDD, Monitor etc) of the computer. The web page contains buttons captioned “add”, “show”, “update” and “delete”. When “add” button is clicked, the pages shows a dialog box to get the details of the item to be added and inserts it to the IndexDB. Implement the functionality of the other buttons. Consider (name, manufacturer) as the primary key.

14.	Write a simple web page in a web application running under tomcat. The web page displays one image and refers to one JavaScript source file. Use HTML5 application cache to cache all these in the web browser. Check if they are really cached or not. Now shutdown the tomcat and test the page is working or not.

15.	Write a web page that generates a factorial table using a web worker. The main page sends an integer number (say 5) and the worker returns the factorial table (1 to 5) and the main page finally displays it. 

16.	Write a servlet to display the message “Hello World”.

17.	Develop a simple chat web page for using WebSocket.

18.	Develop a simple web page (use SSE) showing price of at least two stocks. 
 
19.	Create a web page with appropriate forms, and servlets, to perform each of the following actions:
a.	Form 1: Accepts a string, and displays a list of students whose name contains the given string, their roll numbers, dept_name etc.
b.	Form 2: Shows a drop down menu containing the names of all departments (generate this from the database), and when a particular department is selected, a list of all students in the department is displayed (as in the previous question).

20.	Write a JSP page to display the message “Hello World”.

21.	Write an application as follows: For the first request, the server generates an HTML file to display the integer 0, with two buttons captioned “prev” and “next”. If the user clicks on the next button, the server sends the integer next to the one displayed. Similarly, when prev button is clicked, the server sends the integer previous to the one displayed. Track the session this using, Hidden fields, URL Rewriting, Cookies, and Session API 

22.	Design a simple page to open an account. The page should contain one text box for login name, one password box and other information. Use AJAX technology to inform if the login name typed is available or not. Write a target JSP page to insert data supplied in the form into the database.

23.	Write a web page that contains two drop-down lists captioned states and districts(initially empty). The first one contains the names of states in India. When a specific state is selected, the second one should be populated by the values obtained from server using AJAX technology. Create suitable tables in the database. When a specific state and district is selected, get the information using AJAX and show it.

24.	Design a simple login page. Use AJAX technology to print appropriate error message in case of a login failure.

25.	Write a Java class as follows:
a.	The constructor takes the name of an XML file containing object type questions with answer.
b.	The insert() method inserts the questions together with the options and answer into the database table.
c.	Now write a page that allows user to upload an XML file and use previous class to  insert questions into the database 

26.	Write a JSP page to retrieve all the questions together with options and generate a HTML file as follows:
a.	Each question will have query text and a set of radio buttons one for each option.
b.	HTML page contains a submit button.
c.	The visitor answers the questions by selecting appropriate radio buttons and finally presses submit button.
d.	Also write a JSP page to collect the answers and to inform how many of them are correct after consulting the database.
27.	Use Ajax Technology to change the password of a user. The page usually contains three password boxes and one button. The user will type the old password in the first field and new one in the rest two.

28.	Write a XSLT file to transform a XML question file into a HTML file.

29.	Create a database table to store the user names and the corresponding passwords. Also write a JSP page to verify the login name and password supplied by the users through the page designed in 15 against the values stored in the database tables.

30.	Create a database table to contain price, manufacturer and model of different components (such as HDD, Motherboard, processor, RAM, Monitor, CD/DVD R/W etc.) of a computer system. Create an html form where user will select model and manufacturer of different components and asks for the total price. Write a JSP page to display the total price of the system for the given configuration after obtaining the information from the database.

31.	Create a database to store the marks of all students in all semester in all subjects. Write a JSP page to select the semester, roll number and subject. JSP page will in turn find the corresponding marks and display it. You can make your own assumptions depending upon your needs.

32.	Design a HTML page to create an account. The page should contain one text box for login name chosen, two password boxes (for double verification), one for email address, one for your name and one for your contact number and others ( if you think necessary) . When a visitor provide these data, validate them using JavaScript code. If all data are correct, send it to JSP program (say create.jsp) which inserts the data into database tables. Also write pages to check whether a user can now login or not.

33.	Write a JSF page for user login:

34.	Write the page to change the password of a user using JSF technology. The page usually contains three password boxes and one button. The user will type the old password in the first field and new one in the rest two.
